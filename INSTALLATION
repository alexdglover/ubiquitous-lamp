Twenty Eleven + Slider WordPress Theme

**************************************************

Installation
1. Unzip the file
2. Copy the entire "twentyeleven+slider" folder into www/wordpress/wp-content/themes
3. Copy the "galleria.classic.min.js" file into www/wordpress/ (one of the Javascript files makes a call to a DOM object to append part of the script
directly to the page and ignores relative file paths)
4. Go to the admin console of your WordPress install, choose Apperance-->Themes, and select "Activate Now" under "Twenty Eleven + Slider"
5. Add/remove images to/from the "slider_images" directory as you see fit
6. Enjoy
